This project aims to address the concerns of a typical UNSW student, who is enrolled in courses that use WebCMS3. Under UNSW’s new trimester system, courses are accelerated and due dates can arrive quickly, and sometimes surprisingly. As a result, little time is available to prepare and get to know the requirements of courses prior to taking them.

Our project is to create a simple web application for students to view a list of all their WebCMS3 due dates – assignments, labs, project milestones and exams – ahead of time, with the option of being able to export them to their Google or Apple calendar for viewing later. This aims to assist students with the understanding of their courses ahead of time and when under a tight schedule.
